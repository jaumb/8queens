The make file assumes g++ is installed on the host computer.

On my desktop computer, it runs in a little under a minute so it may take longer depending on the host machine.

BUILDING and RUNNING:
$ make
$ ./main

CLEANING:
$ make clean


Setting explanation for Simulated Annealing:

By and large I chose my settings by experimenting with different values. My main variables consist of the stating temperature for T and the method of calculating the current temperature. After reading a few papers on simulated annealing I settled on calculating T using the formula T = T_0 * (.95)^n where T_0 is the initial temperature and n is the number of steps from the starting board state to the current board state. I also experimented with a fixed value to subtract from T each iteration (i.e. T = T - 0.5, T = T - 0.1, etc...) but these did not perform as well as the other temperature update method.

One of the papers I read suggested introducing a constant k which is calculated once for a particular initial temperature T using the variance of the difference between the current board state and a goal state. Introducing k dramatically improved the performance of my implementation.

I settled on a jump chance of e^(k * -deltaE / T) where deltaE is the difference between the cost of the previous board state and the cost of the current board state.
